## Script for fetching VIX and Fear and Greed values. 

Used in an iOS shortcut to show as a notification. Setup is as follows:

1. Install "Scriptables" on your iOS device and create a script with the contents of "script.js".
2. Create an account on rapidapi and enter your api key in the scripts request header.
3. Clone the following iOS shortcut: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/dc1e0338a1134b3fa041c8c9b8649fb6
4. Choose your script in step the first step of the shortcut without a parameter. You might have to update the dictionary values throughout the shortcut to the correct outputs.
5. Optional: Setup an automation in the shortcuts app to make it run at a certain time or event.

You might not see scriptable in the shortcuts app for the first step. Simply go to the scriptables app's settings and and create a new shortcut under "Siri shortcuts" - then it should show.
If it still doesn't show, manually copy each step from my iOS shortcut into the new one created from the scriptable app.
